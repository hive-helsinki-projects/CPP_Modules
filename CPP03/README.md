# CPP_Module_03 INHERITANCE

## Key Concepts
- Inheritance: Mechanism where a new class (derived) inherits properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (base).
- Base Class: The class being inherited from.
- Derived Class: The class that inherits from the base class.

## ex00: ClapTrap
- Objective: Implement a basic class called ClapTrap.
- Key Concepts:
    - Class Definition: Define a class with attributes and methods.
    - Constructors and Destructors: Implement default, parameterized, copy constructors, and a destructor.
    - Member Functions: Implement functions like attack, takeDamage, and beRepaired.
    - Initialization List: Use initialization lists in constructors.

## ex01: ScavTrap
- Objective: Create a derived class ScavTrap that inherits from ClapTrap.
- Key Concepts:
    - Inheritance: Understand how to derive a class from a base class.
    - Constructor Chaining: Ensure proper chaining of constructors and destructors.
    - Overriding Methods: Override base class methods and add new methods specific to the derived class.
    - Access Specifiers: Use protected access specifier to allow derived classes to access base class members.

## ex02: FragTrap
- Objective: Create another derived class FragTrap that inherits from ClapTrap.
- Key Concepts:
    - Further Inheritance: Reinforce the concepts of inheritance by creating another derived class.
    - Constructor and Destructor: Ensure proper construction and destruction chaining.
    - Operator Overloading: Implement the assignment operator for the derived class.
    - New Methods: Add new methods specific to FragTrap.
