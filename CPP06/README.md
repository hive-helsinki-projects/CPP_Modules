# CPP_Module_06 C++ casts
## ex00: Conversion of Scalar Types
In this exercise, you will implement a program that converts scalar types (char, int, float, and double) from a string literal. The main goal is to handle various edge cases and invalid inputs gracefully.

### Key Learning Points:

- Understanding and implementing type conversion in C++.
- Handling exceptions and edge cases.
- Using std::stoi, std::stof, and std::stod for conversions.
- Implementing static methods and private constructors to prevent instantiation.

## ex01: Serialization
In this exercise, you will implement a simple serialization and deserialization mechanism for a Data structure. The goal is to convert a pointer to a Data structure into a raw integer type and back.

### Key Learning Points:

- Understanding serialization and deserialization.
- Using reinterpret_cast for type conversions.
- Implementing static methods and private constructors to prevent instantiation.

## ex02: Identify Real Type
In this exercise, you will implement a program that generates random instances of classes derived from a base class and identifies their types using both pointers and references.

### Key Learning Points:

- Understanding polymorphism and dynamic casting.
- Using dynamic_cast to identify types at runtime.
- Implementing virtual destructors in base classes.
- Handling random number generation and seeding.
